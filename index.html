                <h1>The Difference Between Dynamic and Static Websites</h1>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In general, dynamic means capable of action and/or change, while static means stationary or fixed.
                Dynamic
                and Static websites are terms used to describe two types of sites and the method they use to display.
                Here
                we will explore what the terms mean for web design.
            </p>
            <h1>Static Websites</h1>
            <p>
                A Static Website (sometimes called a flat or stationary page) is displayed in a web browser exactly as
                it is
                stored. It contains web pages with fixed content coded in HTML and stored on a web server. It does not
                change, it stays the same, or "static" for every viewer of the site.
            </p>
            <p> A static website does not require web programming or database design. Static is the most basic form of
                website and are the most simple to create and are perfect for small scale sites. Maintaining a large
                number
                of static pages can become a time consuming and impractical hassle very quickly. If you require a
                website
                with hundreds of pages and a ton of content, a dynamic website may be for you.

            <h2>Advantages</h2>

            <em> Quick and easy to develop</em> <br>
            <em> Cheap to host and develop</em>
            <h2>Disadvanteges</h2>
            <em> Content can become stagnant</em><br>
            <em> Requires web development expertise to update</em>
            <h1>Dynamic Websites</h1>
            <p><span>A Dynamic Website </span>(also referred to as a database-driven site) requires web programming and
                database
                design.
                A dynamic website contains information and content that changes, depending on factors such as the viewer
                of
                the site, the time of the day, the time zone, or the native language of the country the viewer The
                content
                of your site (text/images) is stored on a database or content management system. When the information is
                updated or changed within the database, it changes on the site.</p>
            <p>When a user visits your site, data is passed to the server from the user's browser. When a dynamic site
                is
                accessed, pages are generated on-the-fly (or in real-time) to the user based on this data from the
                visitor.
                Scripting code analyzed and interpreted on the web server and the resulting HTML is displayed to the
                visitor's web browser. This means different content can be generated at different times of the day, or
                based
                on cookies (little pieces of data that a web server stores on a visitor’s computer), or environmental
                variables (what kind of browser is being used, what a user's IP address is, or what page they visited
                prior
                to the current page).</p>
            <p>This means many great things for yourself and your visitors. You can use a content management system to
                handle all of your files and data that would typically need to be updated on a regular basis such as
                news or
                products, or you can use your dynamic website for e-commerce purposes such as storing and updating
                products,
                and handling orders.</p>
